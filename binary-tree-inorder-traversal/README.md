<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/">94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr>Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

 
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]


Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []


Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100


 
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
